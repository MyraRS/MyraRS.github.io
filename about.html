The inspiration for this website was from a talk about the Earth's pollutions that I listened to at my school. I wanted to do something about it, so I created this website. Where everyone can browse through places that have eco-friendly or sustainable items. As stated in Genesis 2:15, That the Lord took man and asked him to work it and keep it. I created the website with this scripture and the Earth's well-being in mind.</p>

                    <h2>How this site was made?</h2>
                <p>This site was made in certain steps: the first was to look at other website which also had a listing type of website, then I moved on to drawing a sitemap and some rough sketches of the site, which provided help when makeing the actual site. Next, I looked for a suitable bootstrap theme, and I found from startbootstrap.com. Bootstrap is an existing CSS library that already has styling thst is responsive depending on the user's browser screen size, and also provides a sample page that can be used as a starting point. Finally, I used Visual Studio Code to write all of my HTML coding.

                    <h2>Future improvements</h2>
                    <p>To better my website in the future I think it would be better if I there was a search option to find specific shop rather than having to scroll down, and to have regular updates about the curtain situations concerning sustainability of the Earth. Another improvement that can be made is to have more shops added to the categories, and also to add items from each shops for the views to see.</p>
